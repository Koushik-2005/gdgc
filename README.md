Fake Store Project README 
Introduction
The Fake Store project is a minimum-implementation, interactive e-commerce web application that lets users search for products, add items to a shopping cart, and finally checkout. Here's how one would create a dynamic, interactive interface using the three languages-HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Features

Product Listing: Enable the user to view a grid of fetched products from the Fake Store API
Search Facility: Support the user to search a product by name.
Shopping Cart : Adds the products to the shopping cart, product details, and also change the quantity .

Checkout Process : Checkout with ease with the user by having a simple checkout alert.
Technologies Used
HTML : Architecture of the web application.
CSS : Styling as well as the layout of the application.
JavaScript: Hamburger functionality, API calls for fetching data, cart functionality, events, etc.
 Fake Store API: Source of product
 File Structure
index.html: Index HTML - the file containing the application structure
gdgc.css: CSS file for styling the application
gdgc.js: JavaScript file that's handling the application logic and interactions
Setup
Clone the Repository:
 
bash
Copy code
git clone [repository-url]
cd fake-store
Open index.html: You can simply open the index.html file directly in your web browser.
